WorseThanHipster,Theres a big difference though liberal tears is about voters Americans half the country most of whom are tryin to get by like anybody else And its generally about anything that upsets anyone they disagree with for pretty much any reason But these are legislators If R legislators are upset its because theyre losing the power to continue to do what they are doing to our country It doesnt mean we want the constituents to suffer For the lost part a lot of us want those people to be happy to and honestly believe that they will have better lives if they get the same healthcare education public transportation clean environment that we want.I think its more like this https pbstwimgcommediaDLezChcUEAE6zy3jpg.tbh.not about disagreeing mate The whole point of the sub is just to point out when redditors talk about being downvoted Its weird Its a weird king to do We think its funny ..Also Social Outrage Warriors Social JustUs Warriors.bc thats where the pee is stored .Prepare your kids for feudalism I dont wanna take any shit from my wage slaves.chesticles testicles .yes.The title of the show Sherlock is a subtle nod to the main character.fuck those statues tbh.You didnt post any facts You asserted that I was lying about something I have proof for You made factual assertions about Peyton Head I asked you to provide proof you just said internet The lies you were spreading were started by a neonazi website If its OK with the mods here Ill post an archive of the site although it is still up but I will not link directly to it If you want to spread negative rumors about students staff faculty at mizzou we request you use reputable local news sources rmizzou is for students faculty and mizzou alumn We place the safety of our fellow tigers above all else It is not for slander witchunts or culture wars There are hundreds of subreddits dedicated to those Youre welcome to push your narrative there. nonsense and fart noises downvotes omg u must be right they r downvoting u.Hey OP wanna remove the falsity that is primarily white men are disenfranchised disenfranchised to deprive of a franchise of a legal right or of some privilege or immunity especially to deprive of the right to vote If were talking about the US no part of that is correct White mens income immunity to prosecution above minorities who commit similar crimes and generally the ability to self actualize is unequivocally still beyond that of other minorities.Oh uh huh Its not the receiving of pics thats the problem or even hitting on a married woman Its the emotional abuse the anger and the threats that are the issue You know its a normal and healthy thing to respect the women you love and not cling to romantic relationships with people you dont respect Look I didnt mean to come wanna be a dick I know youre struggling man .wut Its not a place yknow Thats not how reddit works Also what about muh freeze peeches whyy r you tryin to control the narrative sry to violate ur safe spaces you sjws need to learn to tolorate people you disagree with.Sometimes sometimes the entire impetus behind a sub is well shittyracistMRAlikeetc For drama where one brave soul naively goes to one of those subs to politely give their opinion and they get shithammered and called names by the sub et al I would like to reserve the right to point out that its in that subs nature to behave that way so long as I do it with humor and not a jerky tirade of a toplevel comment.You mean like when that white kid murdered 9 black people in a small historic church and said he was pretty much trying to start a race war That wasnt even long ago The the media Doesnt care about white Poole is literal neonazi propaganda and youre spreading it if you even care .Disproportionately to what .Youd be very wrong No rape is okay I think even criminals should be treated with basic human decency the justice system isnt perfect

OpiatedDickfuzz,Check out Rogans podcast with Freeway Ricky Ross Rick the largest cokecrack dealer on the west coast during the height of the crack epidemic was pushed out by the CIA in order to put a more profitable operation in his place to provide illicit funding for noncongressionally approved projects .That really grinds my gears .Pablo Escobar Thats not how you spell CIA.Definitely an AK47 The right arm of the socialist world .While it might prohibit testing of state employees or private citizens any field of employment that has any federal regulatory oversight will be tested Namely the DOT and all licensees under their supervision Pilots truck drivers train conductors freighter pilots Id imagine any federal works too .Not feasible for a number of reasons 1for the most part Africa has terrible soils oxisols that are not conducive to adequate food production While there are soils that are somewhat decent when it comes to crop production in africa they are limited to small areas hence the fairly normal looking output but large food insecurity problems The main reason behind the insecurity being the lack of adequate logistic networks to process store and transport food reliably and safely Corruption also plays a large role in distribution deficiencies 2 Fertilizer availability Because the soils general suck fertility amendments are imperative to meaningful production Again the distribution and subsidy networks for this vital component is lacking and thus you see areas with terrible productivity and virtually no ooutput So while it seems like local food is the answer its not as simple as that unfortunately .Stick it in ya asshole real slow like tssssssss.The most nuanced word in the english languagehttps youtubehnTbsbpB65I.And the test results determined that he did in fact collect three 45 caliber data points in Dallas in 2005.Remindme 7 hours.yeezy http iimgurcoml3DCsAxjpg.I worked with this firefighter out west for a summer He said that if the fire season wouldnt start by Mayjune he knew other firefighters that would drive up these little canyon roads and just toss matches out the window every couple miles to try and start a fire so they could get some hours really fucked up .Under 18 USC Sec 793f is it legal to store classified information on an unauthorized server .So Robert Creamer and Scott Foval explaining with their own mouths how they committed mass voter fraud and incited violence at trump rallies isnt real because ACORN If the contents of the videos arent real why did both of them resign .lol subpoenas are nonnegotiable a subpoena is granted on the basis of evidence of wrong doing he wouldnt have to worry about cancelling plans if he didnt criminally destroy evidence in the first place .well i believe that it is her turn and Benghazi was a right wing attempt to crucify her but she was there on 911 so women are capable of holding office and she has a foreign policy background or something so this really doesnt matter .My favorrrrrite thing to do with hardcore feminists when they get all uppity about issues like this and say how come we only recognize male inventors like Edisons and Ford etc I say okay Right now off the top of your head name 3 female inventors Its like dividing by zero on a calculator They explode And if they give you that bullshit about oh its because were oppressed when they cant answer it memorize 56 notable females and rattle them off And then throw the ball back into their court okay so how is it that I know these and you dont I mean you call yourself a feminist but cant even name any notable women Do you not care about these women And then just keep it going .what you quoted isnt the statute that im referring to f Whoever being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document writing code book signal book sketch photograph photographic negative blueprint plan map model instrument appliance note or information relating to the national defense 1 through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust or to be lost stolen abstracted or destroyed or 2 having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust or lost or stolen abstracted or destroyed and fails to make prompt report of such loss theft abstraction or destruction to his superior officer Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both so now that were talking about the right statute here Under 18 USC Sec 793f is it legal to store classified information on an unauthorized server .harass people harass you understand pagliano is under investigation for criminal destruction of evidence right and if he didnt do anything wrong why was he granted immunity by the DOJ Im sorry I but fail to see how legitimate investigation of criminal wrongdoing is considered harassment
columbiamissourian,All Missourian staffers aside from the faculty editors are current Mizzou undergrad or graduate students .Id classify it as a friendly competition Reporters who cover the same story as the Trib always like to compare to see which story was stronger It helps us become better reporters I think Theres been a change since the Trib was bought by Gatehouse Because their staff has been cut there are some times where the Missourian will cover an event and the Trib wont they simply dont have the staff to be everywhere at once anymore This is an interesting review of the changeshttp gatewayjrorg20180221thetribunestragedy if youre interested The Missourians now the only locallyowned paper in town which I think has shifted our relationship with them.One con is related specifically to being a student journalists at the Missourian tend to cycle through since we usually report for a class so reporters startleave every semester Community members are sometimes understandably wary when a new journalist comes to them asking the same questions theyve answered before for the reporters that came before them We try to combat this by helping new reporters get up to speed on certain issues we regularly report on our editors give new reporters a minibootcamp on the most important things to know and as we gain experience we gain more knowledge Another con in general is that its tough to be one of five reporters in town working on the same story Say if a homicide happens thats five reporters at least knocking on the victims door asking to speak with family members and I recognize that it can be hard for people who have just experienced a potentially traumatic event to answer the same questions over and over A pro is that theres always healthy competition Every newsroom wants to have the best story about something so were always brainstorming about ways to cover a story that other outlets might not think of It also forces us to think creatively to find stories that no one else has reported on .1 The Missourian receives press releases for local events so were always up to date about those types of events that will occur We also regularly check things like the jails 0700 report that says who was booked in the jail overnight and the Missouri State and Highway Patrols crash reports to see if theres anything we need to follow up on Personally I interact with the Columbia Police Department pretty regularly so Im in touch with their public information officers fairly frequently I also have some topics Ill write multiple stories about such as court cases as they progress so Ill touch base with relevant sources such as attorneys every so often 2 Im not sure if Id say its more challenging in the age of Trump It might just be that more people are now aware of the challenges facing journalists now that its been highlighted on a national stage The biggest misunderstanding in my opinion is that we only care about clicks and like to be sensational From day one were taught how to ethically conduct interviews and write stories We want people to read our work and yeah we do make mistakes Its every reporters worst nightmare when a correction has to be issued for a story but it usually happens at least once because were human But we care a lot about what we do and at the end of the day we just want to tell peoples stories to better the community and inform the public about important topics Sometimes our reporting literally changes things a reporters investigation into the backlog of untested Missouri sexual assault evidence kitshttps wwwcolumbiamissouriancomnewsstatenewswhenevidencegoesuntestedsexoffendersgoundetectedadvocatessayarticle77966370b50c11e7a53c1bcdc16eba13html spurred the Attorney Generals office to conduct an audit of the untested kits 3 Im currently working on a project about the effects of the opioid epidemic on Missouri Its cost the state a lot of money and over 900 people died from overdoses in 2016 There are several groups working to improve treatment options though and MUs medical school also has revamped their curriculum to teach more responsible prescribing practices Another issue Maternal health care in rural areashttps wwwcolumbiamissouriancomnewsstatenewslackofmaternalhealthcareputspregnantwomenatriskarticled2866e12e1c911e78b8c93b934e103c5html Missouri ranks 42nd in the US for maternal mortality The story highlights some solutions Edit to include one more public health issue This was a story from last yearhttps wwwcolumbiamissouriancomnewslocalovercomingdiabetesthroughchurchesincolumbiasafricanamericancommunityarticlec319b6f0264411e7a74a232c0bd98a91html that relates specifically to Boone County about how black people who have diabetes were four times more likely to die from complications related to the disease than white people The story talks about some of the ways local AfricanAmerican churches were trying to decrease that disparity.Sorry for the late reply It could have been more relevant to put the individual Boone Countyarea legislators votes in the article I will remember that next time Thank you for bringing this to my attention Kaylin Burris .This quote you pulled from Rep Cheri Toalson Reisch is about the foster care bills being pushed through legislation not the child marriage laws Sorry if that did not seem clear in the article Kaylin Burris
